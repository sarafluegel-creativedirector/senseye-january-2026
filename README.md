🚀 Project Overview
This repository hosts the interactive executive wrap-up for Senseye as of January 2026. The report details a pivotal inflection point for the company: the final weeks of preparation before the Phase III clinical trial—the largest of its kind to be submitted to the FDA.

📈 Key Highlights (January 2026)
Phase III Kickoff: Final countdown to the first patient-in on February 23, 2026.
Rear-Camera PLR Enabled: Transitioned ocular tasks to the rear camera, resulting in higher-resolution imagery, improved frame rates, and stronger signal robustness—particularly for individuals with darker eye color.
Voice Task Introduced: Successfully integrated speech-based emotional analysis into the diagnostic, with excellent initial results in differentiating PTSD groups.
Australia Advanced Overseas Finding: Granted in record time, significantly expanding the R&D tax rebate base to cover eligible clinical spend in both Australia and the U.S..
Platform Stability: Validated at 10,000+ participant runs with infrastructure built to operate at clinical scale.
Expanded Data Foundation: Doubled training data using the EVE dataset (2.6 million frames) with infrared ground-truth measurements to strengthen model robustness.
